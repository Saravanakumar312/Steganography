# Steganography
This project implements a basic steganography technique to embed secret data within a BMP image file. The program allows for encoding and decoding of secret files (e.g., .txt, .doc) into or from the BMP image. By exploiting the redundancy in the image data, the secret data can be hidden without noticeably affecting the image's visual appearance.
